***TL;DB*** Our Efficient Data Sampling (EDS) based self-training framework. Firstly, raw data samples are clustered based on similarity in road classes among image encodings â€” generated by an encoder. Then, a small subset is uniformly formed from all clusters for annotation to train the teacher model. After training, pseudo-labels of the unlabeled set are generated using the
teacher model, and the student model is trained on real and pseudo-labeled sets to achieve better generalization.
